# Linux VFS Benchmark

## Introduction

This benchmark assesses the performance of the Virtual File System (VFS) in the Linux kernel, specifically focusing on sequential and block-oriented file operations. The benchmark includes tests for sequential reading, block reading, sequential writing, and block writing to evaluate the efficiency and speed of these fundamental file system operations.

## Features

- **Sequential Reading:** Evaluate the performance of sequential reading operations on the file system.

- **Block Reading:** Measure the speed of block-oriented reading operations.

- **Sequential Writing:** Assess the performance of sequential writing operations to the file system.

- **Block Writing:** Measure the speed of block-oriented writing operations.
